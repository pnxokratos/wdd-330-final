    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Javascripts localStorage can be used to save key/value pairs in the web browser. The data is stored even if the
        browser is closed.<br>
        Syntax for saving is as follows: localStorage.setItem(“key”, “value”);<br>
        Values can then be accessed through grabbing the info via key<br>
        Syntax for this: var newVariable = localStorage.getItem(“key”);
        </p>
        <h2>Mobile first tips</h2>

        User won't spend their time to tell you that your web app is not good.<br>
        Ask only the more necessary things in forms.<br>
        When asking for passwords is better to show the password and give the option to the user to hide it<br>
